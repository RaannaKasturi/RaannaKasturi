- Hello, I'm Nayan Kasturi, aka Raanna. I'm a Student of Biotechnology & Bioinformatics, with a curiosity for new and old technology, alike.
- I'm highly intrested in the new era of AI revolution and a firm believer of "_AI For All_". And thus my project exists, [Project ANJALI](https://github.com/RaannaKasturi#project-anjali-).
